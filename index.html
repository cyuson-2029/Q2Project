			<p> The Role of Citizens in Waste Pollution </p>
			<div class = "wave"></div>
			<p> Waste pollution is one of the most concerning problems in today's society. Everyday, our 
				environment slowly deteriorates as a result of the collective action of not throwing trash in their designated areas.
				This has heavily contributed to the effect of Climate Change. However, we the citizens have the power to stop this calamity.
				By working together to spread action and awareness, we can minimize the effects of Waste pollution and build a brighter future
				for the next generations. You can help stop Waste pollution whether it be from simple actions like segregating your garbage to 
				bigger actions like advocating about the effects of waste that is not properly disposed of. As citizens, each and every choice
				we make has ability, strength, and power. That's why we should stay mindful of what we do.</p>

			<p> WHAT WE ADVOCATE FOR </p>
			<p> We are advocating about the importance of proper Waste management. Our wish is to aide in the fight against pollution and climate change.
			Every citizen has a role in the environment, and this should be made known to all so that individuals may learn to be more mindful of
			every action they make. Actions such as segregating trash, community service, and more all play key roles in making our society better.
			Environment accountability is a must, and by embracing accountability and empowering each other to care about the our surroundings, we can 
			build a clean world that we are proud to live in.</p>

			<p> Main Concepts </p>
			<p> Waste Management is important because it allows for citizens to observe cleanliness and help the environment. </p>
			<p> Pollution Awareness exists in order to let people know what kind of threat they are facing. This helps shape other people's
			mindset in order to aide in the protection of our environment.</p>
			<p> Empathy is the key to consistent efforts in environment protection. This concept allows people to love and care for the environment which
			may help individuals do more than what they are expected to do.</p>
